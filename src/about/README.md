# Story of the Dots

![ceylon-progress logo](/story-of-the-dots.png)

This 4 color dots concept was introduced by [Naveen Buddhika](https://www.facebook.com/Naveenb99), who is a talented graphic designer from Sri Lanka. The concept was introduced to use as the theme for the [peaceful protest](https://gohomegota.online) started on 4th April, 2022 against the corrupted Sri Lankan government.

This concept was then used as the base theme for many creative and artistic work done by Sri Lankan professionals to show their support for justice.

To support this revolutionary movement of Sri Lankans, I decided to use the same theme to power this open source CSS loading animation library.

By using this library you can show support and love to Sri Lanka and Justice!
